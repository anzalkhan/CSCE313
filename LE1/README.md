# <p align="center">Lab 1: Environment Setup, Debugging, and C++ Refresh<p>

## Introduction

The objective of this programming assignment is to help you get ready for the remainings labs and programming assignments by covering some introductory refresher topics. Through this assignment, you will complete setting up your own development environment on GCP where you will work until the end of the semester. You will learn the use of debuggers (gdb) to debug your programs, and recap the core concepts of C/C++ programming.

## Tasks

You are given a simple program, **buggy.cpp**, that computes the area of shapes. Unfortunately it has several compilation errors and several runtime bugs that you are going to discover, debug, and fix with the help of three different debugging methods. Once you have corrected the program and committed to your Github repository, we will use the auto-grading feature of Gradescope to grade your project.

Submit your program to Gradescope and it should autograde for you and generate a score.

## Due Date
The assignment is due midnight Sept 4. Note that the late penalty for submission is 1% per hour.
